- 👋 Hi, I’m @josegerar
- 👀 I am interested in learning new programming languages, keeping up to date with development technology and improving my English level.
- 🌱 I am currently learning the basics of python, to know how it works, what can and can't be done with it and the proper ways to do it. 
      Also, always looking to increase my English level.
- 💞️ I am looking to collaborate in projects that involve the development of new technologies, the improvement of existing processes, 
      and activities related to artificial intelligence.
- 📫 You can contact me through my email jgarcia24121996@gmail.com
